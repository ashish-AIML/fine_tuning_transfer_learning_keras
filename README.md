# Fine Tuning of Imge Classification with Transfer Learning in Keras Model

This is summary readme for validating the accuracy levels after fine tuning the image classifier on custom data using keras


run [fine_tuning_vgg](fine_tuning_vgg.ipynb) in Google Colab

The phases include:

1. Neural Network Building. Here, VGG16 was build
2. Train the model with custom data and fine tune the parameters from pre-trained model
3. Save the strained model
4. Load the trained model and check the testing accuracy
